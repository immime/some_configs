Thanks to Wandisco, which is maintaining the rpm packages for latest Subversion version. This article will help you to Install Subversion-1.8.9 ( SVN Client ) on CentOS/RHEL 7/6/5 Systems. If you want to configure Subversion server visit this article.
Step 1: Setup Yum Repository

Firstly we need to configure yum repository in our system. Create a new repo file/etc/yum.repos.d/wandisco-svn.repo and add following content as per your operating system version.
For CentOS/RHEL 7 Users:

[WandiscoSVN]
name=Wandisco SVN Repo
baseurl=http://opensource.wandisco.com/centos/7/svn-1.8/RPMS/$basearch/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
For CentOS/RHEL 6 Users:

[WandiscoSVN]
name=Wandisco SVN Repo
baseurl=http://opensource.wandisco.com/centos/6/svn-1.8/RPMS/$basearch/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
For CentOS/RHEL 5 Users:

[WandiscoSVN]
name=Wandisco SVN Repo
baseurl=http://opensource.wandisco.com/centos/5/svn-1.8/RPMS/$basearch/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
Step 2: Install Subversion Package

After adding above repository, install Subversion package using yum command line package manager utility.
# yum clean all
# yum install subversion

In case you face any issues with existing installed subversion, remove that and try again with above commands.
Step 3: Verify Subversion Version

At this stage you have successfully install Subversion client on your system. Lets use following command to verify version of svn client.
# svn --version
